Winter swells from the North Atlantic provide powerful, well-formed waves that break over rocky reefs and sandy bottoms. The point breaks offer rides of 50-150 meters, with multiple sections providing opportunities for cutbacks and bottom turns. The warmer water compared to European destinations makes it an attractive winter escape.",
        "surfing_history": "Taghazout's surf scene began in the 1960s when European hippies discovered the area's waves during their overland journeys to India.

        "local_culture": "The village maintains its traditional Moroccan charm despite the influx of surfers. Local fishermen still launch their boats from the same beaches where surfers paddle out. The community has embraced surf tourism while preserving Berber traditions. Tagines, mint tea, and the evening call to prayer create an authentic cultural backdrop to the surfing experience.",

Mid-length boards (7'6\" to 8'6\") are ideal for the mellow point breaks, while shorter boards work for more advanced surfers tackling Boilers or Anchor Point on bigger days. A 3/2mm wetsuit is sufficient for most of the year, with a 4/3mm recommended for December-February.",
        "accommodation": "Taghazout offers everything from budget hostels to luxury surf resorts. Many visitors stay in traditional riads or surf camps that include meals and lessons. The village has transformed from a simple fishing community to accommodate the growing surf tourism, with options for every budget and preference.",
        "dining": "The local food scene blends traditional Moroccan cuisine with international options. Fresh seafood is abundant, and tagines are a must-try.

The Moroccan government's investment in sustainable tourism infrastructure aims to protect the area's natural assets while supporting the local economy.
